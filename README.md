# ZEOTAP_Intern_Assignment
This repository contains the solutions to the Zeotap intern assignment, comprising three distinct tasks: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights, Lookalike Model development, and Customer Segmentation/Clustering.

## **Tasks Overview**

### **Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights**
- **Objective:**
  Perform EDA on the provided dataset to derive actionable business insights.
- **Steps:**
  1. Conduct a detailed analysis of the data, including visualization and statistical summaries.
  2. Derive at least 5 business insights.
- **Deliverables:**
  - A Jupyter Notebook/Python script containing the EDA code.
  - A PDF report (maximum 500 words) summarizing the business insights.

### **Task 2: Lookalike Model**
- **Objective:**
  Develop a Lookalike Model that recommends 3 similar customers for each user based on their profile and transaction history.
- **Features:**
  - Utilizes both customer and product information.
  - Assigns a similarity score to each recommendation.
- **Deliverables:**
  - A CSV file (`Lookalike.csv`) containing top 3 recommendations (CustomerID: C0001 - C0020) with similarity scores.
  - A Jupyter Notebook/Python script explaining the model development process.

### **Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering**
- **Objective:**
  Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques with profile and transaction data.
- **Features:**
  - Flexibility to choose any clustering algorithm and form 2â€“10 clusters.
  - Evaluate the clustering with metrics such as the **DB Index**.
  - Visualize the clusters.
- **Deliverables:**
  - A report summarizing:
    - Number of clusters formed.
    - DB Index value.
    - Other clustering metrics.
  - A Jupyter Notebook/Python script containing clustering logic and visualizations.
